Hey there! :raising_hand: I developed a simple application to help you to memorize new english words based on your own vocabulary! Challenge yourself to remember the correct translation of the words in your vocabulary!

The app has various features:

 - Login with **Google Sign-In**
 - Local DB made with **Room**
 - Remote DB backup made with **Firebase Firestore** associated with the specific user: this enables you to retrieve your vocabulary from multiple devices
 - Use of **WorkManager** to manage the tasks related to the Firestore DB
 - Immediate translation of a new added word through **Google Cloud Translate API**
 - Use of **Retrofit** to manage authentication and translation tasks
 - Use of **Timber** for logging
 - **Clean Architecture**
 - **MVVM**
 - **Dependency Injection** made with **Hilt**
 - **Navigation**
 - **LiveData**
 - **Coroutines**

Here some screenshots of the app (**OUT SOON: new graphics + PlayStore availability**)
